# ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS
ðŸ—¿ðŸ“„âœ‚ Rock-Paper-Scissors project from The Odin Project.

The game runs in the browser (not on the console), using prompts and alerts (at least until I learn about DOM manipulation).

The program allows you to play multiple games in a row or stop playing after someone wins.
